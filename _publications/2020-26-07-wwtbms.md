Who wants to be a millionaire is a famous TV show in which participants go through questions of different topics with increasing monetary values addressed to each question.
The final question is worth $1 million, according to the country the show is presented on.
The scenario created for this paper is one of which the player is in the final question and have two life-lines remaining: Ask the Audience and 50/50. 
This paper seeks to evaluate which strategy results in a greater likelihood of the best outcome (winning the game). 
Using Monte Carlo simulations, strategies based on intervals achieve a greater mean return relative to probability. 
The strategies 50/50 followed by Ask the Audience and Ask the Audience followed by 50/50 are simpler,
but require a large percentage of votes to achieve the best outcome.
